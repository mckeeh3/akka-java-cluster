## Akka Java Cluster Example

### Installation and Running

~~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/mckeeh3/akka-java-cluster.git
cd akka-java-cluster
mvn compile
~~~~
The following Maven command runs a signle JVM with 3 Akka actor systems on ports 2551, 2552, and a radmonly selected port.
~~~~bash
mvn exec:java
~~~~
To run on specific ports use the following `-D` option for passing in command line arguements.
~~~~bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="2551"
~~~~
The default no arguments is equilevalant to the following.
~~~~bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="2551 2552 0"
~~~~
A common way to run tests is to start single JVMs in multiple command windows. This simulates running a multi-node Akka cluster.
For example, run the following 4 commands in 4 command windows.
~~~~bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="2551" > /tmp/$(basename $PWD)-1.log
~~~~
~~~~bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="2552" > /tmp/$(basename $PWD)-2.log
~~~~
~~~~bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="0" > /tmp/$(basename $PWD)-3.log
~~~~
~~~~bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="0" > /tmp/$(basename $PWD)-4.log
~~~~
This runs a 4 node Akka cluster starting 2 nodes on ports 2551 and 2552, which are the cluster seed nodes as configured and the `application.conf` file.
And 2 nodes on randomly selected port numbers.
The optional redirect `> /tmp/$(basename $PWD)-4.log` is an example for pushing the log output to filenames based on the project direcctory name.
